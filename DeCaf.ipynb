Our `Word Embedding` model will be used to vectorize our train data.\n",

Also it can have a lot of stopwords that can make the model confused. We have removed all this to make our data as clean as possible. After the cleaning process, out data only contains words that are not stopwords, present in the english dictionary and has lenght greater than three."
